# mcrscon
A Rust reimplementation of [mcrcon](https://github.com/Tiiffi/mcrcon), made for fun and profit. I cannot overstate how heavily most of the work for this project was done by [rust-rcon](https://github.com/panicbit/rust-rcon/blob/master/src/packet.rs), whose code for representing, serialising, and deserialising packets was shamelessly stolen by me.
